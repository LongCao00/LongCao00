## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi there!

I’m Long, a tech professional with a background in quality assurance and a growing passion for data analytics and web development. I started my career in QA, where I spent over a year testing, improving systems, and ensuring great user experiences.

Since then, I’ve been expanding my skill set into data analytics and development—currently studying at McMaster University and gaining hands-on experience with tools like Power BI, R, SQL, Tableau, Selenium, etc.

I enjoy working on real-world projects that involve problem-solving, data storytelling, and building tools that make a real impact. Whether it’s creating dashboards, automating testing, or integrating APIs, I love learning new things and collaborating with others to get results.

Always curious, always learning—and always happy to connect!
